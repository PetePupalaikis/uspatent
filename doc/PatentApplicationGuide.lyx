Foreword
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am indebted to several people who contributed by reviewing this document,
 teaching me some LaTeX tricks and especially teaching me about patents.
 Let me say ahead of time that if I ignored or incorrectly dealt with their
 review comments, or have any remaining errors in documentation or LaTeX
 code, the errors are solely my responsibility:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have worked with Gordon Kessler, previously our in-house patent counsel,
 for over ten years.
 He taught me almost everything I know about patents and is the patent attorney
 of record on many of my patents.
 Since I've worked with Gordon for so long, the style I use mostly reflects
 his.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andrew Dommer of Fish & Richardson P.
 C.
 reviewed this document and provided lots of comments.
 I've incorporated or accommodated most of his input and because of his
 input added certain flexibility to these tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tracey Kinsella, the in-house paralegal at my company Teledyne LeCroy, proof-rea
d this document and, as usual, found most of the errors that no one else
 did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amy Hendrickson of TeXnology Inc.
 taught me how to implement the macros responsible for dealing with figures
 and annotations during a lecture she gave at the TeX Users Group (TUG)
 conference in Boston, 2012.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Boris Veytsman reviewed the original document, provided some comments, and
 encouraged the production of a TUGboat article and the submission of this
 work to CTAN.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
About twenty years ago, I had my first opportunity to file a patent on an
 invention.
 At the time, I was asked by our in-house patent attorney for various informatio
n on the invention (usually referred to as a disclosure document) so that
 the patent application could be generated and filed.
 During the process from invention to filing, I was able to make several
 observations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For complicated inventions, as mine tend to be, it is very difficult to
 communicate the technical information to the patent attorney.
 In my case, the first application draft created by the attorney was so
 far off that we basically had to start over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
While it was easy to articulate the design of an instrument using my invention,
 it was very difficult to articulate the invention itself.
 In order to understand what I mean by this very important statement, consider
 the fact that an instance of a fully designed instrument is easy to describe
 through engineering documentation, drawings, software source code, etc.
 but the difficult and absolutely necessary information to provide for a
 patent application is really something different.
 A patent application requires a description that distinguishes a design
 from an invention or more specifically, highlights the inventive portion
 of the design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When the application was filed and when a patent was granted, I was unclear
 about the level of protection that was actually obtained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of my experiences, I determined to become more involved in the patenting
 process.
 In many cases, especially at large companies, the inventor provides a patent
 attorney with some level of information that allows the attorney to extract
 the rest of the information.
 In some cases, the attorney essentially interviews the inventor while trying
 to uncover the actual invention.
 I have found patent attorneys to be helpful in uncovering the invention,
 but overall too expensive to be used for that task; and in the end, I often
 had to teach so many technical details that I thought that it might be
 easier to develop some better understanding of the system so that the informati
on provided to the patent attorneys was already in the right form.
 So, after my first invention I began to write clearer documents that described
 my invention in a form that more closely fit the information required by
 the patent office.
 This made life easier for me and the patent attorney and theoretically
 saved some money.
 But then I found some other problems (more minor than the problems already
 outlined):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I use a lot of equations and these were sometimes difficult for the patent
 attorneys to accurately copy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drawings I created were often rejected by the patent office.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sometimes, through weird actions within my company, things I wrote got rewritten
 in a different way than I intended without my permission or notification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve these problems and in continuing with the vector I was on, I decided
 to actually write the patent application myself.
 To be clear, the application I write is always vetted and modified in the
 end by a qualified attorney.
 I generally only take a first cut at claims just to clarify things in my
 mind.
 I found that once I had a better understanding of the organization of informati
on required for an application, it was not a large step in properly formatting
 the information.
 This led to a new set of problems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The document editing tools have several issues that go against proper patent
 application formatting.
 Often, they offer the user too much flexibility in editing section styles,
 spacing, font sizes, etc.
 that allow for a large amount of inconsistency.
 On the reverse side, they were missing certain key features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some patent application software solved some of the formatting and inconsistency
 issues, but did not solve certain issues and were not flexible enough in
 the area of general document editing such as equation entry and cross referenci
ng.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
About five years ago I discovered LaTeX.
 LaTeX is a document typesetting program that converts text documents with
 markup language into final PDF format for filing.
 LaTeX is software popular in academia and is required by most universities
 for doctoral dissertations.
 It is based on a language called TeX
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
TeX
\end_layout

\end_inset

 created by Donald Knuth
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Knuth, Donald
\end_layout

\end_inset

, a Stanford professor and author of many seminal books on computer programming.
 His aim in creating TeX is to beautifully typeset technical documents especiall
y those containing a lot of mathematics.
 Knuth's goals were very similar to mine in many ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
He was trying to eliminate the middleman in publishing his books.
 He discovered that reviewing proofs of his book and marking up these proofs
 was unsatisfying, especially if he could typeset the book himself.
 This problem is somewhat analogous with marking up patent attorney drafts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Being a programmer, he believed in essentially programming the layout so
 that the result followed certain predetermined rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many rules governing the layout can be handled, again programmatically,
 by the creation of macros written in TeX which leads to much more consistent
 layouts.
 Taken to an extreme, the writer can be limited to access to only a handful
 of macros thereby reducing the capability to mess up the formatting while
 simultaneously freeing up the writer to concentrate on the content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LaTeX has so many capabilities and produces such impressive output (especially
 in the area of handling of drawings and equations) that I set to work creating
 patent applications followed by sets of macros that I reused.
 This work finally culminated in a patent 
\emph on
class
\emph default
 file which, when referenced by a patent application document allows me
 to write beautiful, perfectly and consistently formatted patent applications
 with less effort.
 This class file also automates many aspects of the application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having a programming and engineering background, I enjoy writing in LaTeX.
 But LaTeX can be intimidating to many people and I looked for a solution
 that could expose a broader set of people to the outcome provided by LaTeX
 without exposing them too much to LaTeX itself.
 This is when I found LyX.
 LyX is a document editor that can produce many different kinds of output
 but is mostly used as a front-end for LaTeX.
 It follows a WYSIWYM philosophy which stands for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You Mean
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as opposed to the more familiar WYSIWYG philosophy.
 WYSIWYM is a balance.
 With LaTeX, you write in text using macros but you don't see what you are
 going to get until you 
\emph on
compile
\emph default
 the document.
 Many LaTeX fans say that this is liberating because the writer does not
 constantly fuss with the exact way that the document looks, but I don't
 see it that way.
 Many equations and such written in LaTeX require so much complication that
 I find myself repeatedly compiling the document to see if I got it right.
 This is not liberating.
 WYSIWYM is a balance in that equations are shown as they are written 
\emph on
mostly
\emph default
 looking like they will when typeset.
 What this means is that you get to see the structure of the equations and
 the document to see what it roughly looks like, which is enough to break
 the repeated compilation loop, but you don't fuss over the exact layout.
 LyX is very approachable and easily usable and is the best environment
 in which to write a patent application.

 I am not qualified to give legal advice.
 A patent application is a legal document.

\begin_layout Standard
Mostly, I have to provide this warning because people in category

 I don't want to get sued.
 But seriously, I need to provide this warning because in my discussions
 with category 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 people that I've come in contact with, I've found their reaction to some
 of my opinions like I share in this article to be varied.
 Sometimes they disagree with what I do and therefore with some of the advice
 that I give.
 Some tell me I'm a fool to draft my own applications (I'm not sure why
 since I always advise that the application be vetted, reviewed and improved
 by someone trained and licensed in patent law).
 Most of the smaller disagreements are based on how much of or the type
 of information I choose to provide in patent applications.

 I tend to be explicit and hopefully clear in the spirit of proper information

 Also, please contact me to let me know how these tools are being used and
 how I might improve them.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't know anything about LyX or LaTeX, I suggest you familiarize
 yourself with the features of both.
 If you are already a LaTeX user, then I recommend that you do the following
 and make the following decisions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you are already a LaTeX user, you are in good shape.
 When I say LaTeX user, I don't mean LaTeX expert.
 If you know your way around LaTeX and know the basic idea, then you will
 do fine.
 I assume also that if you are a LaTeX user that you don't need to install
 it.
 If you don't need to install it, skip to step

\end_inset

 for more information and for a tutorial on LaTeX.
 Unless you are not entering equations in your application, you should not
 need to know much about the specifics of LaTeX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you don't have LaTeX installed, then you'll want to install it now.
 You can find some basic installation instructions in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Installing-LaTeX"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "enu:Editor-Choice"

\end_inset

Now that you have LaTeX installed, you'll want to figure out what editor
 you will use.
 Even if you plan to use LyX, I recommend you install a LaTeX editor.
 I recommend the TeXworks editor because it shows your PDF output side by
 side with your LaTeX source and you can jump back and forth between the
 source and output easily.
 Some basic directions are found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Installing-TeXWorks"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now you need to decide whether you want to use LaTeX or LyX.
 If you are a grizzled LaTeX veteran, then you will scoff at the idea of
 entering your patent application in anything other than raw LaTeX.
 I really encourage you to try LyX.
 If you are inexperienced with LaTeX, then you really ought to use LyX but
 I warn you that knowledge of LyX is not entirely a substitute for knowledge
 of LaTeX.
 If you are on the fence, let me give you some added encouragement: if you
 start by using LyX and you change your mind, you can always export your
 document in plain LaTeX and the exported document is very good LaTeX.
 Give LyX a try.
 To install it, follow the directions in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You will probably need some kind of drawing editor.
 To test the suitability of your drawing editor, review its capability of
 producing high quality, properly sized PDF files.
 I supply some instructions for using the most popular Windows

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At some point, all of the additional files you need will come in a standard
 LaTeX and LyX installation (after I submit all of this stuff, that is).
 Until then, you will need to get these additional files presumably from
 the same place you got this document.
 These additional files are, at a minimum, the U.S.
 patent class file for use in LaTeX and the U.S.
 patent layout file for use in LyX.
 Remember, LyX is just a front-end for LaTeX which produces and compiles
 LaTeX code so if you are using LyX, you will need both files.
 These files should be put in the same directory where you intend to write
 your patent application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally, you need a way to get started.
 I recommend that you always start by editing one of the example files.

\begin_layout Section
Starting a New Patent Application
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:Starting-a-New-Application"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A new application is started by creating a new directory for your application
 and copying the files listed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Patent-Application-Files"

\end_inset

 to this new directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea here is that you will rename the file PatentApplication.lyx
 (if you are using LyX) or PatentApplication.tex (if you are using LaTeX)
 to the name of your invention (e.g.
 MyInvention.lyx or .tex).
 You can also rename the Drawings.lyx or Drawings.tex file, but you will need
 to reference the newly named drawings file in your patent application document.
 There is no need to do that.
 You will be editing the information in the new MyInvention file
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
MyInvention file
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and also the drawings file.
 As you edit the drawings file you will eventually remove the need for the
 example drawings.
 You will know when you no longer need the example drawing files and at
 that time they can be removed.
 Don't delete them right away because they are required temporarily to build
 your document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many headaches are created by special characters in file names, so it is
 recommended that your directories (entire directory tree) and file names
 contain no spaces or other strange characters.
 If you want to insert a space, use an underscore 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

_
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to separate words.
 I tend to use a programming style called 
\emph on
CamelCase
\emph default
 (or the technical term 
\emph on
medial capitals
\emph default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After creating your new directory containing your renamed files, you should
 see if they produce the proper output by following the directions in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Driving-Latex-from-command-line"

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 if you are using LaTeX, or 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 If you can produce PDF output following these instructions, then you're
 ready to get started.

 as shown.
 The other is the green arrow to the left.
 Clicking this with the mouse causes the document to be compiled and the
 resulting PDF document to be produced and opened automatically to the right
 of the editor dialog.
 Sometimes you will need to click the arrow twice to get the figure numbers
 updated properly.
 You will see a log at the bottom of the editor.
 If there are problems found, you will need to figure out how to fix them
 before you can proceed.
 Compile often so you remember what you've done and can more easily fix
 any problems that crop up.

The LaTeX document starts with a declaration of the uspatent class.
 Every LaTeX document must contain at least one of these declarations and
 here we specify the file containing the typesetting and macro definitions
 that are used in the patent application.
 It ends with an

 This is followed by an inclusion of a drawings file.
 This file defines how the drawings will be read in, described, annotated,
 etc.

Front matter is, as the name indicates, information that must appear at
 or near the front of the document.
 The information must be provided prior to the title (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Title"

\end_inset

), date (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Date"

\end_inset

), and inventor name (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Inventor-Name(s)"

\end_inset

) in LyX documents, because LyX will expect to emit the title page immediately
 following the last of these three definitions.
 In LaTeX, the emission of the title page is determined by the location
 of the

In case you are wondering, your patent application will look nothing like
 it looks in the LyX editor with the title followed by the date followed
 by the inventor name.
 This is what is meant by WYSIWYM.
 You know that you need all of this information and it needs to go somewhere.
 LyX provides the method of entering this information and later when you
 compile the document, you'll see where it actually goes.

I have been advised that some patent attorneys prefer not to include the
 assignee information in the patent application.
 If you or your patent attorney prefers not to provide this information,
 then simply don't define these fields.
 You should note, however, that in draft mode (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Printing-Mode"

\end_inset

), the patent prints with a confidential heading which does not print if
 the assignee name has not been defined.

To track the progress of a patent during prosecution, a patent application

 This is the number that you refer to internal to your company.
 At my company, this number is provided by the paralegal handling patent
 applications.
 When we are planning on filing an application, she provides a new number
 to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use a numbering scheme which is in the form LEC-YY-1NN0-U1 where YY is
 the last two digits of the year, NN is the number of the patent filed this
 year, and U or D is used depending on whether the invention is a design
 or utility patent.
 By the way, the classes, layouts and all of this documentation pertains
 only to utility patent applications.
 Sometimes the number after the U is used to distinguish related applications
 such as continuations, provisionals and divisionals.
 You will need to find out this numbering scheme at your company and how
 these numbers are assigned.

 These assignments are made in the front matter prior to the invention title,

 LaTeX keeps track of all of the inventors added, so the same macro is used

 The title page output during compilation provides a list starting with
 the first inventor followed by the other inventors in the order that they
 are listed.
 The uspatent.cls LaTeX class file provides for up to eight inventors before

 You will run into some trouble with equations.
 Equations technically form a new paragraph as far as LyX is concerned,
 but they ought not be numbered as paragraphs.
 To solve issues where the equation has a paragraph number, try entering
 a carriage return after the text just prior to an equation and a carriage
 return right after an equation (to ensure that the equation is truly in
 its own paragraph) and then set the environment of the equation to

One of the biggest nuisances in writing a patent application regards drawings
 and the requirements on how they are described and referenced, and how
 the various drawing elements are referenced.
 Some things you must be aware of regarding drawings and patent applications:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drawings must be displayed on pages at the end of the patent application
 following specific formatting guidelines that ensure high quality and clear
 labeling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There must be a section in the patent that provides a brief description
 of the drawings with each drawing listed and described in order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Generally, drawing elements are not referred to by naming the elements on
 a drawing itself.
 Instead, drawing elements that are referenced should have a numbered line
 pointing to the 
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
figure!element
\end_layout

\end_inset

drawing element (a drawing element 
\emph on
annotation
\emph default
) 
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
figure!annotation
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
annotation
\end_layout

\end_inset

and the element should be referred to in the patent application text using
 the elements name followed by the number as a reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every annotated drawing element must be referred to at least once in the
 patent application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each element must have a unique number.
 If an element in multiple drawings is the same, it should be numbered the
 same.
 The corollary is that any element numbered the same is presumed to be the
 same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These drawing requirements cause a cross-referencing nightmare that we attempt
 to solve to some degree using LaTeX and the U.S.
 Patent class file.
 The main problems are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We do not generally know the final ordering of the figures during construction
 of the application.
 This is solved using cross-references on most word processors except that
 the drawing description in the brief description of the drawings must go
 with the correct figure number.
 On most word processors, if the drawings are rearranged, the figure reference
 will correctly connect to the drawing, but the figure numbers will be out
 of order or the numbers will not match the descriptions provided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
While most word processors can account for cross-referencing, they cannot
 work with cross references within figures or other embedded graphics.
 This means that drawing element annotations cannot be automatically cross
 referenced the way figures can.
 Because of this, we cannot know the actual annotation numbers until the
 end of the document creation, but we cannot finish the document creation
 because we can't properly refer to the annotation numbers which leaves
 us gridlocked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Similarly with the figure number problems, the names of the annotated elements
 must match the numbers they refer to.
 As an example, if I refer to the widget [23] in FIG.
 1, then there better be a line pointing to the widget element in figure
 1 and it better be labeled with the number 23.
 The checking and maintenance of this proper connection is cumbersome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way that we partially solve these problems using LaTeX and LyX is to
 provide for an area in the patent application where the required drawing
 and annotation information is filled in.
 Once this information is filled in, the following problems are solved:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The drawings will automatically be drawn on properly formatted pages containing
 header information that is in part provided by 
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
front matter
\end_layout

\end_inset

front matter definitions (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Front-matter"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A section containing the brief description of the drawings will be automatically
 produced containing a list of the figures in the proper order matched properly
 to their descriptions.
 There are also certain obscure punctuation requirements
\begin_inset Branch Patent Advice
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Run-on-Sentences"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in patents that will be properly followed automatically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
annotation!numbers
\end_layout

\end_inset

annotation numbers are automatically assigned and can be cross-referenced
 from within the patent application.
 These numbers are attached to an element name so that drawing annotation
 references can be made with the name and the number so that you can always
 be sure that the element named in the application has the correct associated
 number that annotates the element in the drawing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If certain recommended drawing tools are used (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:TpX"

\end_inset

), the annotation numbers can automatically be added to the drawings themselves
 - something absolutely not possible with any other word-processor.
 Otherwise, if LaTeX based drawing tools cannot be used, an annotation number
 list is generated in draft mode (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Printing-Mode"

\end_inset

) that breaks the gridlock by allowing the annotations to be cross-referenced
 properly and produce the correct numbers during application construction
 and the drawings annotated properly (albeit in a manual manner) at the
 very end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before going into too much detail about how this all works, I want to explain
 to you the basic directions you will need to follow regarding your drawings
 to make all of this work.
 First, about the drawing file; if you are using LaTeX, your drawing file
 will be called something like Drawings.tex and will be included somewhere
 near the top of the patent application file (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:The-Layout-of-the-Patent-Application"

\end_inset

).
 Note that this is not a requirement - you are perfectly entitled to list
 all of your figures and annotations inside your application - it's just
 annoying to have to look at this information constantly at the top of your
 application - but you can do what you want.
 Similarly, if you are using LyX you will have a file called Drawings
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
drawing file
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
figure!file
\end_layout

\end_inset

.LyX that is included at the top of the file.
 Like in LaTeX, these drawing definitions can also be in line at the top
 of your application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inside the Drawings file or inline, you list the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 The argument is the exact name of the file (matching case) without path

 This is the name of the file that will get loaded in the patent drawings
 section and is the name you will use to reference the figure.
 The figure definition statement must come before any other attributes of
 a figure are described like the extension, description, and caption and
 basically assigns the figure number and matches it up with the name defined
 for the figure.

 The argument is the exact text for the caption for the figure.
 Note that the use of a caption on a figure is rare.
 Unlike normal documents that you might be familiar with, a caption is not
 provided for any descriptive purposes in a patent application.
 Instead it is provided mostly to call attention to figures that are not
 actually part of an invention.
 The only use I have ever come across for a caption is to distinguish

 are things already done before and things already done before cannot be
 patented or be part of an invention.
 It is, however, sometimes useful to provide prior art drawings that are
 either necessary to describe to someone how to practice the invention or
 in discussions within your patent application to distinguish between what
 you have invented shown in one figure versus what has already been done
 in a figure with a prior art caption.
 If you provide a prior art caption, it should be all upper case.
 Be careful labeling things as prior art, for once submitted as such, the
 patent office will consider this an admission that the material in the
 drawing is not patentable.

 after the figure is displayed inside the Drawings Section (see

).
 LaTeX has very sophisticated algorithms for the placement of floating diagrams
 (called floats or float environments).
 Generally, LaTeX is allowed to use its own algorithms to place floats properly
 and this works out well.
 Your patent figures will be placed either in the center of the page or
 will be doubled up with other figures, depending on LaTeX's decisions.
 LaTeX does not like many floats listed one after another and after about
 ten such floats, it generates an error and asks for help.
 This is a problem that I'd like to try to solve automatically but have
 not been able to.
 So, when this error occurs you must break up your figure list with an instructi
on to clear the page after the drawing is placed.
 This allows LaTeX to flush out its list of drawings and start over.
 For patents with lots of drawings, you might need instructions in two or
 three locations.
 Generally, you can always give this instruction after a large drawing that
 you know will be on a single page anyway and its always safe to unconditionally
, except for the last drawing, clear the page (you will just get one drawing
 per drawing page, which is not too bad).
 Do not clear the page after the last drawing.
 To clear the page after a drawing, use the

For each annotation within a figure, annotations are defined.
 Annotation definitions are associated with the last figure definition occurring

 The argument is the the name you will use to refer to the annotation when
 cross-referencing.
 The annotation definition statement must come before any other attributes
 of an annotation are described like the name and description and basically
 assigns the annotation number and matches it up with the name defined for
 the annotation.

 The argument is the exact text that should be used for the element in the
 drawing.
 This text should ideally be one word and certainly as few as possible so
 that when the text is used within the patent application, the application
 reads properly.

environment in LyX.
 The argument is a description sufficient for identifying the element in
 the drawing.
 This text should be as descriptive as possible.
 The annotation description will not appear anywhere in your patent application
 except it will appear in the annotation list (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:The-Annotation-List"

\end_inset

) when the application is printed in draft mode (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Printing-Mode"

\end_inset

).
 The sole purpose of the annotation description
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
annotation!description
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is to allow the author to match annotation numbers and names with the elements
 in a figure and primarily provided as an aid when the drawing annotation
 numbers are drawn into the figures at the very end.
 For example, a reasonable strategy for producing the application is to
 fill out the annotation while writing the patent so that the annotation
 numbers and names can be referred to within the application.
 Then, at the very end, the annotation list is printed and the author manually
 goes to each drawing, connects a line to the element described by the annotatio
n description and adds the correct number.
 Using this strategy, you can see that it is essential that when this step
 is performed, the description is sufficient to properly identify the element
 in the drawing.

 referred to.
 As such, a dependent claim is the sum of another claim and the contents
 of the dependent claim.
 A dependent claim is always narrower in scope than the claim to which it
 refers.
 This means that if a dependent claim is infringed, the claim referred to
 must also be infringed.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
run-on sentences
\end_layout

\end_inset

There are several locations within patent applications that include what
 I term run-on sentences.
 These are sentences begging for some periods when read by non-legal personnel.
 Some areas where this occurs are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
cross-references to other applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
claims
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
descriptions of the drawings (although see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Brief-Description-of-Drawings-customization"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These occur when elements are being itemized.
 The proper sentence structure is to list each of the elements delimiting
 each with a semi-colon until the next to last element which also contains
 an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If the sentence continues after the list ends, then the last element has
 a semi-colon and the sentence continues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a normal, layman’s description of an invention might look like
 this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Box Boxed

hor_pos "c"
has_inner_box 1
inner_pos "t"

An instrument is produced in a manner such that it has improved measurement

 The instrument has elements A, B, and C.
 Elements A and B are connected to each other.
 This connection causes element C to have improved measurement speed.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The claim language for this might look like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

an element B; and

an element C;
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

whereby the element A and the element B are connected to each other, and
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

whereby the element C has improved measurement speed and the instrument
 is faster.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some other observations to make about this sentence, but the primary
 one I want to make here is that it is in fact a single sentence.
 All of the elements in the sections listed above are written in this manner
 as a single sentence making heavy use of the semi-colon and colon.

citations
\end_layout

\end_inset

When other works are relied upon in a patent application, they must be cited.
 Works might be cited in a cross-reference (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Cross-references"

\end_inset

), in statements regarding prior art typically used to distinguish your
 invention from things done in the past, or for terminology and establishment
 of the enabling quality of your application.
 As an example, if your invention relies on a chemical processing technique,
 you might want to cite a paper that describes this technique so that a
 reader can read this paper to understand terminology that you will use
 regarding this technique or so that there is evidence that others skilled
 in the art can read this paper and practice this technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inventors are not required to search for and cite all possible sources of
 information.
 Some things are so ordinarily known (like the Fourier Transform in signal
 processing or the operation of the transistor in electronics) that they
 go without saying.
 If, however, you know about prior art material that the examiner might
 find relevant to the review of your patent application, especially related
 patents, you will need to provide this material along with a patent application
 in the form of an 
\emph on
Information Disclosure Statement
\emph default
 (or IDS).
 Patents only need to be identified since the patent office can easily access
 the material.
 The provision of this material is adequate and meets sufficiency requirements
 as they are assumed to be part of the patent application even when not
 cited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People familiar with journals and other scholarly works know about typical
 citation rules which involve particular formatting rules.
 These rules provide for the exact manner the work is cited and where the
 cited work exists.
 Usually, in scholarly works, the citation is a subscripted number or other
 reference and the actual citation appears in a footnote or at the end of
 the article in a bibliography.
 Patent applications have no such rules except:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
citations are not referenced with numbers or other referencing formats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
patent applications do not have footnotes or bibliography sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
citations appear inline with patent application text.
 This looks awkward, but it's how it's done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Citation formats should follow reasonable formatting rules.
 Citation of a patent or patent application generally contains:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The words US Provisional or US Utility Patent or US Patent Application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The number (a patent number looks like x,xxx,xxx and a patent application

 It is written entirely in a single sentence paragraph with no line breaks

This section is where the field of the invention is very briefly described.
 The brevity of description cannot be over emphasized.
 It is used only to help the patent office properly classify the application
 and to ensure it is dispatched to the proper examiner.
 It consists of one or two sentences.
 An example is:
\end_layout

The present invention relates in general to network analysis and network
 device measurements.
 More specifically, one or more embodiments may relate to measurements of
 a device under test (DUT) whereby the measurement instrument connection
 to the DUT is made utilizing fixtures or probes whose effects it is desirable
 to remove.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We refer to our invention as the present invention
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
present invention
\end_layout

\end_inset

 where present means the invention in this application.
 The field of the invention starts with a general field and then transitions
 to a more specific field as shown in the example.
 The field refers mostly to the field of problems and solutions, not detail
 about our invention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Field of the Invention should be as short as possible as to not limit
 the claims.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Background of the Invention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
background of the invention
\end_layout

\end_inset

This section is where prior-art and sometimes present day problems are described.
 It helps to tell a story to the examiner to help him gain the context of
 the invention.
 In the background, we do not talk about our invention.
 Instead, we tell a story about what the world looked like before the invention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The story starts as far back as necessary to give the proper context, but
 be as brief as possible.
 For example, a patent application for an invention for a probe de-embedding
 method in network analysis might talk first about network analysis and
 probes in general.
 With a context for the invention established, a well written background
 gradually transitions into describing various problems especially problems
 related to those involved in the invention.
 In many situations, especially in crowded fields, it is important to describe
 prior art solutions, taking specific interest in describing the drawbacks
 of prior-art methods, especially those addressed by the invention.
 Also, you should mention characteristics of the prior art that is different
 from your invention (but without mentioning your invention - you cannot
 contrast, only mention these characteristics).
 Just remember, here is not the place to say anything about the invention.
 Pretend it doesn't exist, but talk about problems that will be solved by
 the invention.
 Usually, after describing lots of problems, this section ends with a paragraph
 that begins: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is needed is....
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where you state problems that need a solution (but list only the problems
 that your invention will solve).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should take care in writing the background because you will be stuck
 with any admission that something is prior art.
 You should also be careful that you don't cause the reader to believe that
 your solution is obvious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Objects of the Invention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
objects of the invention
\end_layout

\end_inset

This section is where the problem being addressed is described.
 A good transition between the previous section on the background and this
 section is to begin with a paragraph that defines a broad object, like
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It is an object of the invention to overcome the drawbacks of the prior
 art
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Then you can state: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It is therefore an object of this invention to...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where you list the problems you will solve with your invention.
 You want the list of objects to match up well with problems needing solution
 listed at the end of the previous section.
 If you do it right, it lines up perfectly and sets up the context and expectati
on in the readers mind regarding solutions during the remainder of the specifica
tion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually, this section is relatively short and is simply a list of objects.
 The first paragraph starts as mentioned above and usually this first paragraph
 lists only the first object.
 The next paragraph starts like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It is another object of the invention to....
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The paragraphs continue until all objects are listed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, refrain from writing anything about how the objects will
 be attained.
 Keep the reader in suspense with only the promise that the objects will
 be met.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
End this section with some boilerplate statements that allow you to not
 be limited only to the objects listed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Usually, you should wait until you are almost finished with the application
 to fill in this section, because you will want the complete list of drawings
 in the drawing section to be correct and in order first.
 If you are using LaTeX or LyX to write your application, you do not have
 this concern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The description of the drawings has the section title: Brief Description
 of the Drawings.
 The brief descriptions are prefixed with language like: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

For a more complete understanding of the invention, reference is made to
 the following description and accompanying drawings, in which:

.
 If lesser ways are useful too and especially if these lesser constructions
 are covered in your claims, they should be described also.
 Describing all related constructions or possibilities you can think of
 is not necessary but ought to be described because it can increase the
 scope of legal protection offered.
 This is one of the things that make patent application writing so tedious.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When describing the invention, try to avoid overly definitive or absolute
 statements like never, always, etc.
 and try to use words like may, can, etc.
 Use words like preferably.
 You may want to make statements like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 art
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
skilled in the art
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to follow your instructions to construct or practice the invention.
 What this means is that if your invention is an electronic circuit, you
 are not required to first teach an undergraduate engineering course but
 your instructions must enable an electrical engineer to follow the instructions
 and obtain the stated benefit of the invention.
 I personally choose to err on providing more information, especially for
 important patents because of the possibility for continuations.
 Also, non-enablement is not often challenged by an examiner, but might
 be determined long after your patent is granted during litigation which
 can invalidate it.

\begin_layout Subsection
Claims
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
claims
\end_layout

\end_inset

This is where the claims are made.
 The claims are the actual rights that you obtain.
 Think of it this way: All of the rest of the patent serves only to tell
 a story, teach the best method and techniques known and to clarify language
 that you will employ in your claims.
 As such, the rest of the application (called the specification) serves
 to entitle you to an invention through your teaching.
 But, when all is said and done, the claims are your only patent rights.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Claims characterize the invention and are written with the help of a patent
 attorney skilled at patent prosecution.
 They are best drafted jointly where the inventor clarifies the defined
 protection and the attorney helps draft verbiage that meets legal requirements
 and ensures the desired protection is obtained.
 Despite the need for an attorney, it helps to understand claims so you
 can at least define the invention and clear things up in your own head.
 It also helps to attempt the drafting of claims so that you can ensure
 that the specification contain support and needed definitions that can
 be employed in the claims.
 It is highly useful to draft claims prior to writing the specification,
 but I admit that I have never been successful doing this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Claims are the invention.
 The goal of claims writing, is to describe a set of elements and their
 configurations such that if anyone else were to build something with each
 and every element listed in the configuration stated, they would infringe
 your patent.
 The goal is not to provide a set of instructions that enable the building
 of the invention, only a minimum set of elements or steps to distinguish
 the invention over the prior art.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually, when filing a patent, one writes a number of claims constituting
 the invention.
 In order to infringe
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
infringe
\end_layout

\end_inset

 a patent, an infringer would need to have every element in a configuration
 dictated by a single claim.
 When making claims, the first claim is an independent claim.
 When a claim is independent, it stands on its own.
 Subsequent claims may be independent or dependent.
 A dependent claim always begins with a reference to a previous claim like
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The method of claim 1 further comprising\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 When a claim is dependent, the claim is a further constraint on the independent
 claim.
 If you are confused about this, simply take the entire claim referenced
 and place it at the front of the claim.
 That is actually exactly how a dependent claim is interpreted.
 If a dependent claim is dependent on another dependent claim, then it's
 even further constraining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Independent claims are always the broadest claims and dependent claims are
 always narrower.
 If an infringer infringes a dependent claim, the claim depended on is also
 always infringed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strategy of drafting claims involves starting with an independent claim
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
independent claim
\end_layout

\end_inset

 written as broadly as possible.
 The broadness is dictated by trying to ensure that no prior-art can be
 found that would match all of the elements in the claim in a non-obvious
 manner.
 Subsequent dependent claim
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
dependent claim
\end_layout

\end_inset

s are then drafted which narrow the claim scope.
 The thought is that if someone were to copy the invention and the patent
 was litigated, that the copier would need to infringe dependent claims
 that would hold up better to prior-art scrutiny.
 The narrower a claim is, the less likely a copier would need to infringe
 it (making it technically less useful), but also the less likely for invalidati
on through finding prior-art or through claims of obviousness.
 In summary, we shoot for claims that are broad making it more likely for
 a copier to infringe, but hedge our bets through narrower claims that are
 more likely to survive litigation.

Here you will find the patent office drawing requirements.
 To basically summarize the requirements that are worthwhile describing:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drawings must be in black ink.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Things that cannot be drawn, like screen images and photographs are permitted
 under certain circumstances, but I advise redrawing and retouching somehow
 to put in solid black ink form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
They must fit well within the page.
 They must fit with a margin of 1 inch on top, 1 inch on the sides and 3/8
 inch on the bottom (meaning that a drawing cannot be larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $6\frac{15}{16}^{"}\times9\frac{5}{8}^{"}$
\end_inset

).
 To be on the safe side, use a drawing package with absolute size control
 on the final output and set the size to 
\begin_inset Formula $6^{"}\times9^{"}$
\end_inset

 max.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Other than annotations (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Drawings"

\end_inset

), use as few words as possible on the drawings - drawing elements are described
 in words within the specification.
\end_layout

If you are an inventor trying to take a first shot at writing a patent applicati

 If you are a patent attorney trying to use these tools to improve your
 patent application flow, you will invariably desire various changes to
 meet your style.
 The first, easiest customization is in the naming and inclusion of various
 sections.
 The names and the sections you wish to include is up to you and can be
 changed easily by editing the PatentApplication.tex or PatentApplication.lyx
 template documents which you are free to do.
 More difficult customizations can be performed by editing the uspatent.cls
 and uspatent.layout files, but these will require excessive skill with LaTeX
 and LyX.
 There are some relatively easy customizations that have been anticipated.
 These can only be made with LaTeX code, however (use

\begin_layout Standard
When using Visio
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Visio
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the preferred method is to create your pictures in a two step process:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create your picture in whatever tool is appropriate.
 Visio is a good tool for creating basic engineering diagrams, but other
 tools might be appropriate.
 Make sure this picture is no bigger than 
\begin_inset Formula $5"\times8"$
\end_inset

 to allow for annotation lines to extend outside the picture boundaries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Import your picture into Visio.
 In the case that the picture was created in Visio, import the picture into
 another Visio document using [insert][object] and then check the create
 from file check box.
 Browse to your file and import it.
 If you are creating a visio drawing within visio (recommended), then use
 [insert][object] and specify a visio drawing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basically, the idea here is to use Visio as a 
\emph on
housing
\emph default
 for your drawing.
 The housing contains the main drawing, sets the size of the drawing absolutely,
 and is where the annotations are drawn.
 The main drawing can be another embedded Visio drawing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using Visio
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Visio
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the annotations must be numbered in Visio.
 This numbering should definitely wait until the end since if you change
 the numbering, you'll have to edit each and every drawing.
 If you want, annotate the drawing with a text label, include the annotation
 in the annotation list as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Drawings"

\end_inset

 with similar descriptive text, and at the very end when you are almost
 finished with the application, go back and change the text to the numbers
 provided in the annotation list that is shown in the application in draft
 mode.

When editing and saving your Visio drawing, you'll want to save your drawing
 in Visio format and save it as a PDF.
 The PDF document is what gets included in the application.
 To do this, you want to use [Save As...], select PDF

 as the type, then make sure the options are set to ISO 19005-1 compliant

 is the best tool for creating LaTeX drawings.
 What's good about it is that it easily allows importing other documents
 and touching them up.
 More importantly though, it allows automatic drawing annotation.
 This section will explain what you need to know to deal with TpX documents.

Unfortunately (for Americans), TpX operates with grids that are metric only.
 TpX drawings are absolutely sized with the origin at 0,0 in the lower left
 corner.
 The numbering of the grids is in millimeters.
 You will want to make sure your drawing is no larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $6^{"}\times9^{"}$
\end_inset

 which means 150 mm 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 230 mm.
 Remember, you will need to place annotation lines outside the drawing,
 so ideally, you want to keep the drawing without annotations to 
\begin_inset Formula $5^{"}\times8^{"}$
\end_inset

 which means 130 mm 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 200 mm.
 Usually, I place a rectangle filled white set to the back with white lines
 (i.e.
 no lines showing) first that are the exact size I want the drawing to be
 so that I don't go outside the boundaries.

TpX is great for annotating because it can be handled automatically.
 This is done by drawing a line to the element and then labeling it.
 The line drawing is self explanatory.
 The labeling should be such that it is aligned 1 mm below the line end
 vertically and lined up with the line end horizontally as shown in

reference "fig:AnnotationAlignment"

Notice in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:AnnotationAlignment"

\end_inset

 that the text properties dialog is shown showing how the annotation is
 labeled.
 TpX enables two types of annotation labels:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TeX - the text you will see on the diagram which can be labeled in plain
 English.
 This text will not actually show up in your figure if there is a Tex te
 label.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TeX te - the text that describes what will be seen in the diagram.
 Note here that we use the 
\begin_inset Index idx

\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
LaTeX!macro!
\backslash
annotateNoBrackets
\end_layout

\end_inset

macro 
\backslash
annotateNoBrackets{input} which tells the document compiler to figure out
 the number that belongs in the label.
 In order for this to work properly, the label input must have been entered
 in the annotation list as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Drawings"

\end_inset

.
 If you don't, the drawing will show ?? for the number when you print your
 application.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned, these text labels can be used in two ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
no TeX te label - the label shown in the drawing and in your document will
 be the label shown in the TeX box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TeX te label provided - the label shown while editing your document will
 be the TeX label, but the label shown when you print your document will
 be the TeX te label which can be a macro, if desired.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If using TpX, you should know that the size of the drawing will be such
 that a box can surround the figure, as seen on the TpX screen.
 This means according to the TeX text shown, which is unfortunate.
 You will need to keep your TeX text short so that it does not make TpX
 think that the drawing is larger than it will actually be when formatted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Text Labels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Text labels may be added to your drawing by using insert text.
 When you insert text, there are many possibilities for how your text labels
 will be shown.
 You can use macros, formulas and other things as well as plain text.
 The strategy you want to follow is when you are inserting just plain text,
 then use insert text and just type it in.
 When you are inserting something other than plain text, like a formula,
 then use insert text, type in some text that you want to see when editing
 the document (you cannot see the actual formula until you view the final
 document), and then edit the text properties.
 When you edit the text properties, you will see two boxes as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:AnnotationAlignment"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TeX - the text you will see on the diagram which can be labeled in plain
 English.
 This text will not actually show up in your figure if there is a Tex te
 label.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TeX te - the text that describes what will be seen in the final output.
 This can be plain text, LaTeX formulas, macros, etc.
 The writing of LaTeX formulas is beyond the scope of this document.
 Just know that you have this capability.

annotateWithName{Thing} with a preferable 
\backslash
annotateWithName{WidgetThingConnection} that enables the

annotateWithName{Widget}.
 I think you get the idea.
  You can refer to the number as
